# CapstoneProject - Weather Prediction Dashboard

This project should predict the Weather on a date well into the future

We hope to create the model, train it, then use it for prediction, which will lead to it being displayed on a dashboard where users can interact with it

<<<<<<< HEAD
For example, a user can enter in a date, the predicted weather for that date will be displayed and shown as a specific temperature or the forecast will be displayed.
